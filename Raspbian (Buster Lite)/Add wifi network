There are two ways to add a wifi network:

1. sudo raspi-config

2. Edit the /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf file directly
  - Follow the format:
    network={
      ssid="<Enter network ssid here>"
      psk="<Enter network password here>"
    }
    
    During boot-up all the networks in this file are checked automatically until a connection succeeds.
